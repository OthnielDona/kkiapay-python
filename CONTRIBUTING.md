# Contributing

All contributions are welcomed. If it's your first time contributing to open source please don't hesitate and just open a Pull Request. Your suggestion/fix isn't stupid, I'll make sure I explain what's wrong with your PR if it wasn't accepted.

## Here are some points to consider:

- Your PR must be making only a single change, if you want to suggest multiple features or fix multiple issues please open separate PRs.
- If you have an idea that will require a lot of work, make sure you suggest it in a new [issue](https://github.com/PythonBenin/kkiapay-python/issues) first to make sure it's admired before investing time into it.
- If you want to contribute and not sure where to start, check the [road map](https://github.com/PythonBenin/kkiapay-python#road-map).
- Pull Requests that don't have a clear explanation of what it does will be closed. Sorry :)
- Keep your code clean. Clean means you're proud of how it turned out.

## How to contribute:

Clone `kkiapay-python` on your machine. Install all development dependencies using:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```
If you haven't used `pipenv` before but are comfortable with virtualenvs, just run `pip install pipenv` in the virtualenv you're already using and invoke the command above from the cloned `kkiapay-python` repo. It will do the correct thing.
